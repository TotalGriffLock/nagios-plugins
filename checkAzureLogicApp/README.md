# checkAzureLogicApp

A script to check the run history of a logic app in Azure
It can probably be used for checking event history on nearly any kind of Azure object

Requires you to create an application in Azure AD and create a token under that application. That application must then have enough permissions granted to review the event history you want to monitor.
